# USB Hub

MY board is a usb hub. I plan on attaching to my cyberdeck I'm building for my raspberry pi. 
The total cost it said was: $9.54

I struggled a bit trying to find all the wires I needed to connect in the creation process. But after that the rest was pretty easy. 
I kinda went off the design the tutorial was showing how to make, by adding two extra ports to it.
